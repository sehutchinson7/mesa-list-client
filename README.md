<h1><b>Species Vulnerability Tracking App</b></h1>
<p> This is the client-side repo for the Endangered Species List application. The app allows users to add species in Massachusetts, and specify whether or not they are endangered.

<h3> Background: </h3>
<p> The goal of this project is to develop a full-stack web application that allows user's to track species of concern in Massachusetts. The idea for this project was based off the MESA List for Massachusetts. For more backgroud information on the Massachusetts MESA List, check out https://www.mass.gov/service-details/list-of-endangered-threatened-and-special-concern-species.

<h3> Technologies Used: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>AJAX</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Handlebars</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
  <li>JSON</li>
  <li>Ruby on Rails (Back-end)</li>
</ul>
<h3> Project Description & Planning Process </h3>
<p> After a user signs up and signs in, they are able to view all animals that have been added to the database. The goal was to for a state or environmental organization.  A registered user can keep track of their entries by clicking on the "View My Animals" button. Additionally, a user can view all entries made into the database by clicking the "View All Animals" button. The user has the capability of updating or deleting their inputs, but not the inputs of their colleagues.

<h3> Wireframes & User Stories</h3>
<p> The project provided a challenging experience in creating a full-stack application skills and technologies. In order to work through these challenges, the developer utilized white boarding for organization and planning purposes:

<h6>Developer Stories</h6>
<ul>
  <li>As a developer, I want to utilize wireframes and whiteboarding for project planning purposes.</li>
  <li>As a developer, I want to create front-end view using HTML and CSS.</li>
  <li>As a developer, I want to set up user forms using AJAX requests and jquery.</li>
  <li>As a developer, I want to provide user with UI feedback</li>
</ul>
<h6>User Stories</h6>
<ul>
  <li>As a registered user, I would like a web app where I can keep track of endangered species in Massachusetts.</li>
  <li>As a registered user, I want to view the entries of other users within my organization</li>
  <li>As a registered user, I would like myself and my colleagues to update the vulnerability status of a species</li>
</ul>
<h3> Next Steps: </h3>
<p> The objective of this game was to create a functional web app outlined above. Next steps would be to seed the databae using a csv file of all the MESA list entries for Massachusetts. Modifications would be made based off of different vulnerablility categories:
