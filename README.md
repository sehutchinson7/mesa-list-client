<h1><b>Species Vulnerability Tracking App</b></h1>
<p> This is the client-side repo for the Species Vulnerability Tracking application. This application allows users to add species in Massachusetts to a database, and specify whether or not they are endangered.
<p>Check out the application: https://sehutchinson7.github.io/mesa-list-client/

<h3> Background: </h3>
<p> The goal of this project is to develop a full-stack web application that allows user's to track species of concern in Massachusetts. The idea for this project is based on the MESA List for Massachusetts.  The goal for the application is to allow users to keep track of vulnerable species in Massachusetts after signing in. A user can view all other species added to the database and also make contributions.

<h3> Project Description & Planning Process </h3>
<p> After a user signs up and signs in, they are able to view all animals that have been added to the database. The app was designed to be used for a state or environmental organization.  A registered user can keep track of their entries by clicking on the "View My Animals" button. Additionally, a user can view all entries made into the database by clicking the "View All Animals" button. The user has the capability of updating or deleting their inputs, but not the inputs of their colleagues.

<h3> Wireframes & User Stories</h3>
<p> The project provided a challenging experience for the developer in creating their first full-stack app. In order to work through these challenges, the developer utilized white boarding for organization and planning purposes:

<h6>Developer Stories</h6>
<ul>
  <li>As a developer, I want to utilize wireframes and whiteboarding for project planning purposes.</li>
  <li>As a developer, I want to create front-end view using HTML and CSS.</li>
  <li>As a developer, I want to set up user forms using AJAX requests and jquery.</li>
  <li>As a developer, I want to provide user with UI feedback</li>
</ul>
<h6>User Stories</h6>
<ul>
  <li>As a registered user, I would like a web app where I can keep track of endangered species in Massachusetts.</li>
  <li>As a registered user, I want to view the entries of other users within my organization</li>
  <li>As a registered user, I would like myself and my colleagues to update the vulnerability status of a species</li>
</ul>
<h3> Next Steps: </h3>
<p> The objective of this project was to create a functional full stack web app outlined above. The next steps would be to add in different vulnerability categories. Modifications to the project would include modifying the database by seeding in a CSV with all the MESA list species for Massachusetts. Additionally, different vulnerablility categories would include: endangered, threatened, and species of concern. The workflow would have to be modified to include different tables and categorize species by taxonomic group, including: Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, Fish, Invertebrates, and Plants. The following user stories could be used as a reference for future work, which would also look at the MESA list from more of a spatial perspective.</p>
<h6>Next Step User Stories</h6>
<ul>
  <li>As a user, I want to track ecological impact over time and by county.</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to view the spatial range of different species of concern in Massachusetts.</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to know when each species was added to the Mesa list so I can assess ecological impact over time.</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to incorporate Geographic Information Science (GIS) to gain a deeper understanding of ecological impact for Mesa list species in Massachusetts</li>
</ul>
